# Roadcast

RoadCast is a web app that shows users the weather forecast along their driving route. If they have a flexible departure time, summary weather statistics for alternate trips are calculated on the back end and used to make recommendations about what time they should leave in order to avoid adverse weather. In addition, users can register and store their recommendation preferences.
